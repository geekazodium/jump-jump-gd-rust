# Instructions I was *Supposed* to follow:

Assuming you have researched (and bookmarked) the material you were asked to find, you’ll take that knowledge to do the following:

Create a GitHub account (if you haven’t already)
Create a repository on GitHub
Include a readme with a brief description of what you’re being assigned to do
Include a Godot .gitignore file
Using GitHub Desktop, clone that repository to your hard drive
Make a branch with your name (no spaces)
Add a couple of files to the branch - images or text files are sufficient
Commit the branch
Push the branch to GitHub
At this point, take the following screenshots (use your computer’s screen capture capabilities - do NOT use your phone):
GitHub Desktop, showing:
the two branches you have
The commit history
GitHub, showing:
The new branch, with the new files
Next, on GitHub Desktop, merge your new branch into the main or origin branch
Commit and push your changes
Take the following screenshots:
GitHub Desktop, showing the history and the main/origin branch
GitHub, showing the main/origin branch
You will upload these screenshots to the assignment – this will be your submission and documentation of your work.

If you’ve done your prior learning, this entire assignment shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.
